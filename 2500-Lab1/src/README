This project is a "card flipping game". The user specifies how many rows and columns
of cards there are. (n rows of m columns) this creates a n x m box of cards.
in this starting position, each card is either face up or face down.
the user specifies each card, giving the orientation (face up, face down), suit (clubs, spades etc.), and value of the card(A,2,3... - K).
the user then performs a max of n + m - 2 flips. There are 4 flips: top, bottom, left, and right. 
the program then outputs all cards that are facing down.

Top flip will take the entire top row of cards, and flip it onto the row directly below. Which changes the orientation of the card.
Bottom will take entire bottom row and flip onto row above. (also changing orientation of card)
Left will take the entire left column of cards and flip it onto the column directly to the right.
Right will take the entire right column, and flip onto the column to it's left.
Each card is given an integer value for computing, and is then returned to it's card after the flips are performed for output.
Each flip is performed, and the cards are flipped and stored in an array of stacks.
main is located in CardStack.
