This project is code for a analytical program.
Program is ran from console, and given any single text file.
Generates 6 different types of linked lists, in order to 
compare performance of them. List 1 is unsorted, list 2 is sorted,
list 3 is a self-adjusting list that shifts the word to the front of the
list every time it is found, list 4 also self-adjusts, but shifts the word
forward only once when it is found.

Program displays total words in the file, run time, total
reference changes made(work done), the vocabulary of the file(distinct words),
and the amount of comparisons that were made while creating each list.
